### Assets folder

In the assets folder we have scripts stylesheets and images.

### Core folder

In the core folder there are php scripts that we send post request from client side using ajax. 

Also there are functions.php file that we defined our functions and there are config.php file for database and mail server configuration.

### View folder

In the view folder we have our view files we include them in our index.php file.

### Index.php file

There is a routing system in the index.php file and we include our pages according to the changing url information.

*Example :* If we go example.com/settings page , routing system calls a function named settings.

```php
function settings($par,$db){
		$dashboardSettings = 'view/dashboard/settings.php';
		if (session('loginsession')) {
			$dashboard=null;
		    require_once $dashboardSettings;
		}
	}
```



## Available social networks

You need add available social networks manually.  

There are two *asn_type* value contactinfo and socialmedia. 

![Profile section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58172827/76896613-37012000-68a3-11ea-81e0-901441ce388a.png)

Users only can add available social network profile links to their profile.

mobilephone , homephone , whatsapp , email and website are pre defined social network types , there must be in the available_social_networks table and also in the *addsociallink.php* we have special control for them. There are input masks for them in the *main.js* file.

**asn_url :** This column is very important. While adding social links users can type their social media profile link's url or username. Fraow parses the url using asn_url value.

**asn_status :** 1 for active, 0 for passive.
